##Some Notes:
1. The call to the function that reads out the docx documents requires the docx document to be in same directory
2. API key must be in the same directory as the pynb file as well
3. The call to openAI API was rejected due to my proxy connection. I had to disconnect from proxy
4. I had preinstalled my jupyternote book from JetBrains package. Many dependencies and packages come out of the box. 
5.
